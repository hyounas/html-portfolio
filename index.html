        <h2>Work Experience - Projects</h2>
        Final Year Project &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Tableau, Excel, KNIME) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (August 2020 - May 2021) <br><br>
        Developed a data visualisation tool in Tableau, portraying the impacts of climate change in the United States and Japan and the resulting
        impact on our wellbeing. The project involved:
        <ul>
            <li>Extensive research and data gathering using published journal articles and pushing to deliver to a tight deadline.</li>
            <li>Data cleansing and project planning using KNIME and Excel.</li>
            <li>Drew an overall system design on draw.io for the project. Implemented an overall system design on Tableau with over 20+ 
                data visualisation worksheets.</li>
            <li>Conducted tests and requested users to detect flaws and collected feedback from users on whether the solution met the project 
                objectives.</li>

        Virtual Reality Game &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (C#, Blender, Unity, Unity Assets) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (February and March 2021)
        <ul>
            <li>Collaborating in a team environment, designed and developed an interactive virtual world with sufficient interaction and operation 
                to depict a fictional military airbase called Area 51. The player movement was scripted in C#, environmental models were created in 
                Blender and these were animated on Unity.</li>

        <h2>Work Experience - Volunteering</h2>

        Enactus &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reading Bag Company (RBC) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (October 2020 - June 2021) <br><br>

        Worked with elderly people in care homes and adults with learning difficulties. Organised bag decorating sessions that encourage 
        social interaction. Then sold these bags as a way to make people in care homes feel a part of the local community and reinvested 
        the money to fund further sessions. This involved using the artwork of the volunteers into digital designs and transforming these 
        to the bags. <br><br>
